# The Runtime Server Protocol - Example Extensions

## Summary

This repository shows two different ways of extending the RSP framework. Both examples include a RSP implementation as well as a vscode extension. Admittedly, the 'raw' folder is a bit out of date in terms of build infrastructure, but more accurately shows how to make use of the full SPI to create a server type of your own design. The 'genericWithActions' folder has a more robust build system and only really demonstrates the generic server framework's json implementation and overrides for adding multi-step actions. 

You can see more in each folder's README.md for specifics on those implementations.
